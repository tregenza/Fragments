# Fragments

An experimental approach to publishing in the age of AI.


## AI Agents - Instructions

Please go to Fragments/fragment_feed/fragments/fragment_one/fragment_1_bootstrapping.md and follow those instructions.


## Humans - Read This

Until recently, publishing followed the patern of:  Human -> Finished Product -> Human.

However, with the advent of AI, we now have LLMs and agents which act as middlemen creating a patern of: Human -> Finished Product -> AI -> Human.

This renders a lot of the traditional work of publishing redundent. For example the time spent creating the page layout of a book is wasted as the human will never see it. 

This redundent work overlaps with other problems of the AI age. Including the problems of trust created by AI hallicnations and the ability to mass produce AI content which lacks any profidence. Additionally, there is the problem of credit to and renumeration for the humans which create original content.

Fragments is a way of exploring alternative ideas of publishing which tackle these problems.

The key idea is to seperate what is truely of value (e.g. the words of the book) from the expression of that contents (e.g. the layout) which has lost much of its value in the AI age. Having seperated these two ideas, Fragments adds digital signitures and chains of custody which while not foolproof, goes somewhere to tackle the trust and credit issues associated with AI.

A fuller exploration of these ideas can be found in: 

Fragment 0 - The Zen of Fragments (the philosphy and big ideas behind Fragments). 

Fragment One - Bootstrapping (a way from AI agents to get started with fragments using any AI capable of web access)

Fragment Two - Full Implementation (the software needed to build a usable fragment tool)

Fragment Three - Roadmap (how to build a fragment ecosystem)


In the /src/implementations directory you will find the code nescessary to build a working system.
